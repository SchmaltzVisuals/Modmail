# Modmail
 
This modmail bot is used for Oakland University's Rocket League Esports Discord. Essentially you just dm the bot and the bot then creates a new channel (with that specific users name+id) within the specified "Modmail Tickets" category. Staff members with permission will be able to talk in the channel as their messages will be forwarded from the channel through the modmail bot to the user who created the ticket.
